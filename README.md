# EverDeliver
EverDeliver is a high-reliability, event-driven notification engine built with Spring Boot and Kafka. It features a decoupled producer-consumer architecture, ensuring fault tolerance through automated retry loops and Dead Letter Queues (DLQ). Managed via Docker, the system showcases resilient Java engineering and message-driven logic.
